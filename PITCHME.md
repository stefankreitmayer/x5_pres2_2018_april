# PILOT 3: Teachers

#HSLIDE

## A: The teacher as pioneer/curator

Hypothesis: A teacher can use the interface as if they were a student, in order to find, compare, evaluate, and collect OERs. The resulting collection of OERs will be easy for the teacher to transform into a high-quality course for their students. This won't require adding any features.

## B: The teacher (or peer) as facilitator

Hypotheses:

1. Learners using our system will occasionally need topic-specific help from another human.
2. We can add features that allow a user to monitor and help another user (with mutual consent).
3. This works for peers as well as school-typical settings between students and a teacher.

### Supporting the facilitator

* **notification**, e.g. account messages + optional email.
* **prepared solutions**, e.g. machine-recommended strategies, or previous solutions by other facilitators in similar situations.
* **incentives**, e.g. by making their solution potentially visible by more than one learner.
* **contextual information** to help the facilitator understand the learner's specific predicament in the first place.
