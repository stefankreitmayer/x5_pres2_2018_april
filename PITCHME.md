#HSLIDE

## SIX PILOTS
1. Introduction to Machine Learning
2. UNESCO sites
3. Teachers as curators
4. Users helping users
5. Peer motivation
6. University Learning Environments

#HSLIDE

## Pilot 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
### Students and general public

* Iterative prototyping approach
* Demo of iterations and current version
* Wizard of Oz study: method and results
* Next steps

#HSLIDE

## Pilot 2: UNESCO sites
### General public

* Different requirements -> interface changes
* Presumably shorter experiences
* Users' location (current or future) very relevant
* Search by site name? Search by location and radius?

#HSLIDE

## PILOT 3: Teachers as curators

Hypotheses:
* A teacher can use the interface as if they were a student, in order to find, compare, evaluate, and collect OERs.
* The resulting collection of OERs will be a well-sequenced list of useful, high-quality teaching materials.
* No additional GUI features are required.

#HSLIDE

## Pilot 4: Users helping users

Hypotheses:
* Our users will occasionally need topic-specific help from another human.
* Additional features can allow a user (with mutual consent) to monitor and help another user.
* One solution can satisfy a variety of social relations, incl. teacher&students, study buddies...

#HSLIDE

### Ways to support peer facilitation

* _Contextual information_ that helps the facilitator understand the learner's problem
* _Notification_: So people know when their help is needed
* _Prior solutions_ created by others in similar situations (To what extent will solutions have OER status?)
* _Machine-recommended strategies_ for how to help
* _Incentives_: one solution can help many learners

#HSLIDE

## Pilot 5: Peer Motivation

Learners can benefit from peer activity in many ways besides active helping. Simply knowing that they are not alone can increase motivation and reduce anxiety. Learning together can be fun.

#HSLIDE

Hypothesis: Social features, when designed and crafted carefully, can leverage psychological benefits that improve the learning experience, without causing too much distraction.

> Stefan's MSc students are currently working on this.

## Pilot 6: Students using their institution's Learning Environment

> Requires that the institution integrates our JavaScript into their LE.
