3. Pilot: Teachers as curators
4. Pilot: Users helping users
5. Pilot: Peer motivation
6. Pilot: University Learning Environments

## Pilot 1: General public
### Topic: Machine Learning

#HSLIDE

## Pilot 2: General public
### Topic: UNESCO sites

> The learner's current and future location are likely to be relevant.

## PILOT 3: Teachers as curators

Hypothesis: A teacher can use the interface as if they were a student, in order to find, compare, evaluate, and collect OERs. The resulting collection of OERs will be a well-sequenced list of useful, high-quality teaching materials. No additional features are required.

## Pilot 4: Users helping users

Hypotheses:

1. Our users will occasionally need topic-specific help from another human.
2. New features could allow a user to monitor and help another user - with mutual consent.
3. This works for peers as well as school-typical settings between students and a teacher.

### Ways to support peer facilitation

* _Contextual information_ that helps the facilitator understand the learner's problem
* _Notification_: So people know when their help is needed
* _Prior solutions_ created by others in similar situations (To what extent will solutions have OER status?)
* _Machine-recommended strategies_ for how to help
* _Incentives_: one solution can help many learners

# Pilot 5: Peer Motivation

Learners can benefit from peer activity in many ways besides active helping. For instance, simply knowing that they are not alone in their journey can increase learners' motivation and mitigate problems related to distraction, stress, and anxiety. Besides, learning together can be fun.

Hypothesis: By carefully designing social features that are "passive" and subtle, we can leverage psychological benefits that improve the learning experience, without distracting the learner.

# Pilot 6: Students using their institution's Learning Environment

> Requires that the institution integrates our snippet into their LE.
