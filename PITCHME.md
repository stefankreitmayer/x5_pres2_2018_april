## PILOT 3: Teachers as curators

Hypothesis: A teacher can use the interface as if they were a student, in order to find, compare, evaluate, and collect OERs. The resulting collection of OERs will be easy for the teacher to transform into a high-quality course for their students. This won't require adding any features.

## Pilot 4: Users helping users

Hypotheses:

1. Our users will occasionally need topic-specific help from another human.
2. New features would allow a user to monitor and help another user (with mutual consent).
3. This works for peers as well as school-typical settings between students and a teacher.

### How can we support the facilitator?

* _notification_, e.g. account messages + optional email
* _previous solutions_ created by other facilitators in similar situations (-> OER status?)
* _machine-recommended strategies_ for how to best help
* _incentives_ e.g. by making solution visible by more than one learner
* _contextual information_ that helps the facilitator understand the learner's problem
