# PILOT 3: Teachers

## Case A: The teacher as curator/pioneer

Hypothesis: A teacher can use the interface as if they were a student, in order to find, compare, evaluate, and collect OERs. The resulting collection of OERs will be easy for the teacher to transform into a good course for their students.

## Case B: The teacher as facilitator

Hypothesis: While a student is using the interface, they will occasionally need topic-specific help from another human (e.g. teacher). Our system supports the teacher in providing the right kind of support efficiently
* via prepared solutions, e.g. machine-inferred strategies, or previous solutions by other humans in similar situations.
* via incentives, e.g. by making their solution potentially visible by more than one learner, thus encouraging them to put in more effort.
* via metacognitive support, e.g. providing useful contextual information that helps the other human understand the student's predicament in the first place.

> What if we replace "teacher" with "peer"?
