## Curating is hard

#HSLIDE

## Support for each aspect

* FIND -> optimise search results, ...
* EVALUATE -> show plenty of information per item, facilitate preview, ...
* COMBINE -> visualise relations, modalities, ...
* COLLECT -> keep the links, organise them, ...

#HSLIDE

## Curating vs studying

Someone curating a learning project
* could be a student
* could be a teacher, etc

### Therefore
1. The curation part of our system need <span style="color:#e49436">not distinguish between user roles</span>. (Yay!)
2. Curating (knowledge-centric) and studying (learner-centric) are <span style="color:#e49436">separate concerns</span>. (Double yay!)

#HSLIDE

## MULTIPLE PROJECTS

People may pursue multiple, unrelated projects

-> Our system must <span style="color:#e49436">distinguish between projects</span> in order to avoid misguided recommendations.
